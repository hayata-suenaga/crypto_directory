# Crypto Directory 🐟🐟🐟

This project is part of the interview process for an internship role @ [stake.fish](https://stake.fish/en/).
You can see the hosted website of this project [here](https://crypto-dashboard-33501.web.app/).

### Hello stake.fish Team 👋

Thank you for taking time to review my project! I enjoyed implementing this one.
I added a little note here for your reference when navigating my project.

### Hosting Environment

The projected is served by Firebase Hosting.
You can visit the site [here](https://crypto-dashboard-33501.web.app/).

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode at localhost:3000.
- `npm run deploy`: Builds the app  to the `build` folder and deploys it to a Firebase project.
- `npm cypress:open`: Opens up Cypress

### Dependencies

- `create-react-app`: For bootstrapping the project.
- `typescript`: For static type checking.
- `react-router-dom`: For routing.
- `cypress`: For end-to-end testing.
- `normalize-css`: For resetting css across browsers.
- `prettier`: For formatting.

### Project Structure

- `pages`: Each file inside this directory corresponds to a page. A file might contain un-exported components.
These components are intended to be used only inside the main component of that file.
- `components`: Each file contains a single component that is exported as default.
These components are used more than twice in the project or have the potential to be reused
across the project if the project expands.
- `hooks`: This directly only contains a single file that has some utility hooks used across the project.
- `styles.css`: Since the project is small, all styling is contained inside this css file.

### Note about Cypress tests

Instead of `localhost:3000`, the tests visit
[https://crypto-dashboard-33501.web.app/](https://crypto-dashboard-33501.web.app/).
This is the url where the project is hosted.


Since the project only hits third party api, I decided to stub all network requests with fixtures.
I used responses for each end point as fixtures.

### Final note

If you have time, please check the web application [eisuke.org](https://eisuke.org/) that I've launched.
It's a React web application for students in Japan to learn English vocabulary with fun and efficiency.
