# Crypto Directory 🐟🐟🐟

This project is part of the interview process for an internship role @ [stake.fish](https://stake.fish/en/).
You can see the hosted website of this project [here](https://crypto-dashboard-33501.web.app/).

### Hello stake.fish Team 👋

Thank you for taking time to review my project! I enjoyed implementing this one.
I added a little note here for your reference when navigating my project.

### Hosting Environment

The projected is served by Firebase Hosting.
You can visit the site [here](https://crypto-dashboard-33501.web.app/).

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode at localhost:3000.
- `npm run deploy`: Builds the app  to the `build` folder and deploys it to a Firebase project.
- `npm cypress:open`: Opens up Cypress

### Dependencies

- `create-react-app`: For bootstrapping the project.
- `typescript`: For static type checking.
- `react-router-dom`: For routing.
- `cypress`: For end-to-end testing.
- `normalize-css`: For resetting css across browsers.
- `prettier`: For formatting.

### Note about Cypress tests

Instead of `localhost:3000`, the tests visit
[https://crypto-dashboard-33501.web.app/](https://crypto-dashboard-33501.web.app/).
This is the url where the project is hosted.


Since the project only hits third party api, I decided to stub all network requests with fixtures.
I used responses for each end point as fixtures.

### Final note

If you have time, please check the web application [eisuke.org](https://eisuke.org/) that I've launched.
It's a React web application for students in Japan to learn English vocabulary with fun and efficiency.
